# Encontrinhos Event Platform Project 
This is the second project from Ironhack Web Developemnt course, done in collaboration between Patricia Tami Sakita and Isis Abreu.
## Introduction to the Platform
Encontrinhos is an event platform though to be intuitive and simple to the 60+ audience.
The idea is that our audience could use the site to post new social events just like "Go to the shopping mall" that are part of their day to day and that they would not like to attend alone.
Any new user needs to sign up, then login to start using, then they can create new events. Once the event is posted, any user can register to the event, know more details about it and most importantly: attend the event and make connections!
## Getting Started
New users just need to sign up and then login to start using the application => [Link](https://encontrinhos.herokuapp.com/signup)
